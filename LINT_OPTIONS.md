# Quick Fix: Update flake8 configuration to be more practical

## Option 1: Relax line length (RECOMMENDED)
Update the project to use 120 characters instead of 79, which is more practical for modern development.

## Option 2: Fix core files only
Fix only the main library files and leave examples as-is.

## Option 3: Complete fix
Fix all files to be 79 characters (time-consuming but thorough).

Which approach would you prefer?

1. **Practical (120 chars)** - Quick, modern standard
2. **Core only** - Fix main library, ignore examples  
3. **Complete** - Fix everything to 79 chars

For CI/CD success, I recommend Option 1 (relaxing to 120 chars) as it's:
- ✅ Modern and practical
- ✅ Quick to implement
- ✅ Maintains code quality
- ✅ Acceptable in most projects
